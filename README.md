# Pump-damage-identification
Oscillation Data Analysis and Damage Identification in a Boat Propulsion Mechanism Using MATLAB 

I worked on the propulsion mechanism of a ship, with accelerometers installed at various points to identify potential damage in its components.

For the pumps, vibration measurements were collected and analyzed using Fourier transforms in MATLAB. This allowed the conversion of time-domain signals to the frequency domain, revealing peaks at harmonics of the Blade Passing Frequency (BPF), which indicate early-stage cavitation in the pump blades.

Based on the analysis, the pumps’ RMS vibration levels fall within the ISO 10816-3 yellow “unrestricted long-term operation” zone, meaning they can operate safely for now. Although early cavitation is detected, monitoring is recommended to prevent future issues.
